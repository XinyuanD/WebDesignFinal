                    <b>Hosting Casual Pair Go this Nov 16</b>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people have asked about organizing a time for pair Go, just a low-key time/event.  
                    This will be the original form of pair Go without gender requirements, no fees, 
                    but also no banquet license or cake or donuts … just the fun and goofiness of pair Go.  
                    This is a pure fun event, and it is great to bring life partners, significant others, 
                    beginners, etc., to make Go accessible and fun to them.
                    <br><br>
                    We would love to see 32 or 40 (or more) folks show up and join in for fun.  
                    You can bring a pair partner, ask someone during registration time, 
                    or we can make pairs from singletons.  
                    Pair Go works best with multiples of 8, so that each table with two boards can have two games, 
                    with round 2 being composed of winners playing winners, 
                    and there being a winning team for the table who win both games.  
                    We can work with multiples of 4 if need be.  
                    PLEASE come and play!!!
                    <br><br>
                    Event time is 16 NOV, Sat — registration 1-2pm, round 1 is 2-3:30, 
                    and round 2 is roughly 3:30-5:00.  There will be 40 min of main time with no byo yomi.

                    <b>2024 AGA WA State Championship is coming</b>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are glad to announce that on Dec 7th and 8th, we will host the third annual AGA WA State Championship.  There will be an Open Tournament for strong, qualifying attendees (all even games to determine the state champion) and a Handicap Ratings Tournament.  There will be 5 rounds — two rounds Saturday and three rounds Sunday.  SGC will order pizza for attendees’ lunch convenience, and the cost is $15 per person per day (for 4 slices of a cheese or pepperoni large pie cut into 10 slices).
                    <br><br>
                    The top scoring player in the Open Tournament who has lived in Washington state for six months or more will win the 2024 Washington State Championship title and trophy.
                    <br><br>
                    The top scoring players in the Open Tournament that are employable in the United States win the championship prize money — $300 for top score, $150 for second top score, and $75 for third top score.
                    <br><br>
                    Handicap Tournament cash prizes and youth prizes depend on registrations.
                    <br><br>
                    You must have a current AGA membership.  Please renew ahead of time to make registration easier and to make starting on time possible.  Go to AGA membership join/update page to check your membership status, renew, or join.  Parents, you must make sure your kids are valid members.  If someone cannot become an AGA member before the first round of pairing, you cannot play because we submit all game records to the AGA.
