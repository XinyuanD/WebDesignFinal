                    <b>The best way to learn how to play Go is from an experienced player.</b> <br>
                    Learning face to face is much easier than puzzling out the rules, 
                    even though they are simple and elegant.

                    <span style="text-align: center;"><b>Game of Go: The Definitions</b></span> <br> 
                    The game is for two opponents, or two teams. <br>
                    Black plays first. Then White plays a stone, then black plays a stone, and so on. <br>
                    Stones are placed on the intersections, not the squares. <br>
                    Once a stone is placed on the board, it is not moved for the rest of the game unless it is captured. <br>
                    When a stone touches another stone of the same color along a line, it loses its individual identity and becomes part of a group. Groups can have any number of stones, limited by the size of the board. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="text-align: center;"><b>Game of Go: The Rules</b></span> <br> 
                    A stone or a group of stones must touch at least one empty intersection along a line to remain on the board.  
                    These empty intersections are called “liberties”.  
                    When all of the liberties are filled by the opponent, the stone or entire group of stones is captured 
                    and removed from the board. <br>
                    The other rule, called ko in Japanese, prevents repetition of a board position. <br>

                    Play ends when both players agree that any more moves they make in the opponent&apos;s territory will be captured, 
                    so they choose to pass instead of playing more stones. 
                    One of the ways to score is to count the empty intersections that a player controls. 
                    Another scoring method is to fill in any empty intersections with stones of the surrounding color 
                    and then count all the stones on the board. Whoever has the larger number wins. <br>
                    If you are a beginner, the hardest part of the game will be knowing when you are finished, 
                    and it is time to say “pass”.  
                    It is very helpful to have an experienced player available to show you the finishing moves. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="text-align: center;"><b>For Beginners: The Capture Game</b></span> <br> 
                    A simplified method of play is to end the game as soon as either player captures any stones. 
                    This method is easier for beginners to learn, especially on a small 9&#215;9 board. 
                    A more advanced method is to end the game when five or more stones are captured. 
                    This makes the play more complex because it makes it possible to sacrifice one stone to gain more captives from your opponent, 
                    but this version is still easier than the full game of Go described above. <br>

                        <b>Justin</b> first learned go when he was in the military in 2016 while at his AIT naturally being a japanophile 
                        he was drawn to the game. He first started teaching the game when he lived in china to younger children 
                        whom he was teaching English to as a way of connecting with those students. 
                        Justin believe anything you want to do you can achieve given enough time and effort, 
                        and go being a game of infinite possibilities helps him express that. 
                        Believing in your own abilities helps in all aspects of life.
                        While Justin have no age range he cannot teach, he prefer preteens - adults 
                        since they can sit down and tell him their thought processes behind their moves. <br><br>
