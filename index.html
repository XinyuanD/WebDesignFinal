                    <b>The Seattle Go Center teaches and promotes the Asian game of Go.</b>
                    This 4000 year old strategy board game continues to fascinate players around the world.
                    Japanese professional Go player, <a href="https://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/player/htm/ki001002.html" target="_blank">Iwamoto Kaoru</a> Sensei created The Seattle Go Center (SGC) in 1995, 
                    purchasing a property in the University District. 
                    We are very grateful for the generosity of a Japanese professional Go player, 
                    Iwamoto Kaoru and the <a href="https://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/english/" target="_blank">Nihon Ki-in</a> (the Japanese Go Association to whom Iwamoto Sensei bequeathed SGC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2022, the Nihon KI-in sold the property to a business partner who planned to build a high rise 
                    and give SGC a floor as part of the deal. 
                    Unfortunately, due to circumstances in the world and economic issues in America, 
                    the business partner reneged on the contract and never broke ground, 
                    eventually evicting SGC from the property. 
                    We are temporarily operating from a nice space in the very popular Phinney Community Center 
                    (see the Directions link in the top nav bar). 
                    There will be a settlement to the contract in a few years, 
                    and SGC will be able to buy a permanent place to call home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Seattle Go Center is recognized as a 501(c)(3) public charity.  
                    It is organized as nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of Washington.
                    <b>Featuring a Japanese style tatami room</b> (again, when we purchases a permanent place) 
                    and a larger playing room with display boards for teaching, 
                    SGC provides a nice space for studying and playing Go.
                    The Center also has a reference library.  
                    SGC offers several beginners&apos; books and equipment for sale for convenience.

                    <b>People having been playing Go for 4000 years.</b>  
                    Go is recognized as the oldest strategy game that is currently played by its original rules.  
                    The earliest evidence of it is from China (where it is known as WeiChi), 
                    and it probably migrated to Japan around 500 BCE (where it is known as igo).  
                    In Japan it rose to top cultural status along with samurai and had four prominent competitive schools as well as government support.  
                    It is also very popular in Korea (where it is known as baduk).  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After WWII, Japan spread Go to the western world, and due to this effort, 
                    people tend to use Japanese Go words all around the world.  
                    Often people think it is a Japanese game due to Japan professionals spreading it to the West 
                    and how deeply it is part of Japan&apos;s cultural identity.

                    However, we are limited by number of volunteers and people who can take off work in the afternoons, 
                    especially post-COVID.  
                    We also teach all players for free at our regular open times 
                    and most Sundays at Kids Time (see <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> page).
                    Children are welcome in our Paid Private Instruction Program (see <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page).

                <p>
                    The Go Center has sponsored a Go club at nearby McDonald International Elementary for many years.
                    Our club at Challenger Elementary school, in the Issaquah School District, 
                    met in the winter and spring after school on Wednesdays in 2019.
                    Other schools that have had Go clubs in the past include John Stanford International (Seattle), 
                    Sacajawea Elementary (Seattle), Hamilton International Middle School (Seattle), 
                    Roosevelt High School (Seattle), Forest Ridge School of the Sacred Heart (Bellevue),  
                    Meadowdale High School (Lynnwood), Kimball Elementary (Seattle), the Evergreen School (Shoreline),  
                    and the Seattle United Korean School (Bellevue).

                <p>
                    The Go Center is very interested in starting up more school go clubs.  
                    We find that this process usually this takes two leaders, a Go instructor and an in-school organizer.  
                    We can strive to provide the instructor from among our Go Center staff and volunteers, 
                    but it is best to have a Go club organizer who is already involved with the school.  
                    The organizer might be a parent, teacher, staff member, or older student.  
                    They do not need to know how to play Go; willingness to contribute some time to starting a Go club is sufficient.  
                    In addition to providing an instructor, the Go Center can provide starter equipment, 
                    and help with after-school program applications, including providing insurance, business license, 
                    and a budget.  Since we are a 501(c)(3) public charity, we can also do fundraising, pay instructors, 
                    and pay employment taxes.

                    The generous gift of Kaoru Iwamoto, a professional Go player and educator from Japan, 
                    made the Seattle Go Center possible in 1995, so that we could teach and promote the game of Go in the West.
                    Now it is our responsibility as members of the Go playing community to continue and support that mission with our time and our money.

                        such as the Cherry Blossom Festival and UDistrict Street Fair.  
                        You do not need to be strong player to help out — having intermediate partners to play is a big help to beginners.  
                        And kids love to win games against adults.  If you are interested in teaching, please contact our Program Manager,

                        They translate lectures and lessons given by Asian experts, 
                        and provide translations for visitors from Europe and Asia. 
                        They provide fresh baked bread, computer repair and networking, landscaping, 
                        and help with building improvements.  If you want to take responsibility for a project, 
                        or organize an event, please contact <a href="mailto:manager@seattlego.org">manager@seattlego.org</a>.

                        We welcome donations of Go books and equipment.  
                        The first copy of a book will go into our reference library; 
                        additional copies will be used in our lending library, or as prizes, especially for youth tournaments.  
                        If you upgrade your Go equipment, please consider giving your starter set to the Go Center. 
                        They are very popular prizes at our youth tournaments.

                    The Seattle Go Center is one of the places that makes Seattle special; 
                    it is only the only non-profit organization devoted to Go with its own building in North America.  
                    But that real building and extensive program also have real expenses, 
                    and so we need your financial support through memberships and donations.  
                    Our  voting memberships (quarterly, yearly and lifetime) give you a great deal, with no daily fees, 
                    and they also provide steady support to the Go Center.  
                    Donations in addition to your membership fees are tax deductible on your federal taxes.  
                    Many employers will also match donations made to the Go Center by their employees with their own matching donation.  
                    For example, we are grateful to the Microsoft Corporation and to Google which have already supported us in this manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a membership and donation forms at the front desk of the Go Center.  
                    Please feel free to use them any time your budget allows.  
                    If your employer has a matching grant program, please consider doubling your donation in this way.

                        If you are arranging a matching donation from your employer, our Federal EIN is 91-1653-572.  
                        You may need to search for our former name, “Nihon Ki-in Go Institute of the West”.
